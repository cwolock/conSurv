#' Estimate the conditional cdf of Y given Delta and X
#'
#' @param time Observed time
#' @param event Numeric vector of status indicators of whether an event was observed
#' @param X Data frame of observed covariate values on which to train the prediction algorithm
#' @param test_time Observed times to evaluate against
#' @param test_event Event indicators to test against
#' @param test_X Covariates corresponding to \code{test_event}
#' @param time_grid_eval Grid of time points on which to evaluate (e.g. approximate a MISE integral)
#' @param censored Logical, indicates whether to run regression on censored observations (vs uncensored)
#' @param rescale A logical value indicating whether or not to rescale covariates to have equal variance.
#'        Scaling has an impact on some algorithms, such as LOESS.
