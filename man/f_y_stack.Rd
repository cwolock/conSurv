\usage{
f_y_stack(
  time,
  event,
  X,
  censored,
  bin_size = NULL,
  V = 10,
  SL.library,
  time_basis
)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{\code{n x 1} numeric vector of observed
follow-up times If there is censoring, these are the minimum of the
event and censoring times.}

\item{event}{\code{n x 1} numeric vector of status indicators of
whether an event was observed. Defaults to a vector of 1s, i.e. no censoring.}

\item{X}{\code{n x p} data.frame of observed covariate values
on which to train the estimator.}

\item{censored}{Logical, indicates whether to run regression on censored
observations (\code{event == 0}) vs. uncensored (\code{event == 1}).}

\item{bin_size}{Size of time bin on which to discretize for estimation
of cumulative probability functions. Can be a number between 0 and 1,
indicating the size of quantile grid (e.g. \code{0.1} estimates
the cumulative probability functions on a grid based on deciles of
observed \code{time}s). If \code{NULL}, creates a grid of
all observed \code{time}s.}

\item{V}{Number of cross validation folds on which to train the Super Learner
classifier. Defaults to 10.}

\item{SL.library}{Library of algorithms to include in the binary classification
Super Learner. Should have the same structure as the \code{SL.library}
argument to the \code{SuperLearner} function in the \code{SuperLearner} package.}

\item{time_basis}{How to treat time for training the binary
classifier. Options are \code{"continuous"} and \code{"dummy"}, meaning
an indicator variable is included for each time in the time grid.}
}
\value{
An fitted pooled binary regression for the CDF
